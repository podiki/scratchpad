#+TITLE: StumpWM scratchpads

* Origin
Adapted from code as part of [[https://github.com/herbertjones/my-stumpwm-config][Herbert Jones's StumpWM config]] and discussed on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/stumpwm/comments/98q287/scratchpad/][this thread]] at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/stumpwm/][r/stumpwm]].

* Description
Provides functions (and thus easy keybindings) to raise or hide windows in a split or as a floating window. For example, can have a keybinding to provide a terminal to execute quick commands and then hide it until needed again, or to show a chat program when needed.

* Usage
Load it as a module after copying it somewhere, e.g. ~~/stumpwm~:
#+begin_src elisp
  (set-module-dir "~/stumpwm")
  (load-module "scratchpad")
#+end_src

Then can bind a key to run or raise a program, e.g. a floating termite window:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defcommand scratchpad-term () ()
    (scratchpad:toggle-floating-scratchpad "term" "termite"
                                           :initial-gravity :center
                                           :initial-width 1900
                                           :initial-height 1200))
  (define-key *top-map* (kbd "s-t") "scratchpad-term")
#+end_src
